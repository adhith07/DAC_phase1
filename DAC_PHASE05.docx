Project:
        Air Quality Analysis


Problem Statement:
        The project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data from monitoring stations in
        Tamil Nadu. The objective is to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas
        with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels
        based on SO2 and NO2 levels. This project involves defining objectives, designing the
        analysis approach, selecting visualization techniques, and creating a predictive model
        using Python and relevant libraries.


Approach:
        Design Thinking:
                Project Objectives: Define objectives such as analyzing air quality trends,
                        identifying pollution hotspots, and building a predictive model for
                        RSPM/PM10 levels.
                Analysis Approach: Plan the steps to load, preprocess, analyze, and visualize
                        the air quality data.
                Visualization Selection: Determine visualization techniques (e.g., line charts, heatmaps)
                        to effectively represent air quality trends and pollution levels.


        Checking the requirements:
            First we install the required software and install the modules required for the
            project and then we set up the test environment by changing the path variables
            and we launch the application.
        
        Data collection and warehousing:
            We collect various data in the form of an excel spreadsheet and convert it into
            a CSV file and save it in the same folder where we are going to implement the algorithm.
            We have several data on:
              Stn Code : Contains pincode of the city
              Sampling Date : contains date of sampling
              State : contains the name of the state
              City/Town/Village/Area : contains the name of the City/Town/Village/Area
              Location of Monitoring Station : contains the place where the location of monitoring station is located.
              Agency : contains the state/central pollution control board details
              Type of Location : states whether the area is industrial/rural.
              SO2 : Sulphur di oxide content
              NO2 : Nitrogen di oxide content
              RSPM/PM :  Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter measured.
              PM2.5 : It represents the value of particulate matter measured.

        Approach for making design:

                Data Mining:
                        Data mining or Knowledge Discovery (KD) is used to read and analyze large
                        datasets and then finding/extracting patterns from the data. It is used for predicting
                        the future trends or forecast patterns over a period. Data mining algorithms are usually
                        based on wellknown mathematical algorithms and techniques. There are two types of data 
                        mining learning algorithms: 1) Supervised algorithms and 2) Unsupervised algorithms.
                        We are going to make optimal use of these to train our machine learning model for better
                        prediction. The dataset is provided in the Government website.

                Unsupervised learning algorithm:
                        The Unsupervised algorithm is the process in which the training dataset contains only the
                        input set and not the corresponding target vectors. The main criterion is to find groups
                        or patterns of similar examples within the dataset, called as clustering.

                Supervised learning algorithm:
                        The Supervised algorithm is the process in which the training data comprises of both the
                        training and the corresponding output target vectors. In this project, a supervised
                        learning algorithm called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used for training,
                        validation and testing the dataset. In addition, to the ANN, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
                        model has been used for comparing the performance against the ANN. The below section introduces
                        the processes of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
        
        Test execution:
            We use the pandas,scikit,matplotlib modules in python in order to implement the supervised
            machine learning algorithm and to visualize it in a realistic manner.


Conclusion:
    These steps are considered optimal for getting the desired output.
